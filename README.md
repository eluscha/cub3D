# 3D Advent calendar

Welcome to a "3D Advent calendar", a program created to fulfill requirements of the cub3D project (with bonus) at 42berlin.
The main idea is to use a rendering technique called Raycasting in order to create a first-person 3D-perspective, based on a 2D-map.
The project requires use of miniLibX simple graphics library.

## Features

- Supports wall textures of your choice (.xpm format)
- Supports different maps, as long as they comply with the map requirements.
- Advent calender features correspond to the bonus part of the cub3d project: small gifts (animated sprites) are hidden behind multiple doors (up to 24) in a maze.

### Map files Requirements

- A .cub map file must provide the paths to all the wall textures and the colors (R,G,B) of the floor (F) and the ceiling (C): 
    ```bash
    NO <path_to_north_texture>
    SO <path_to_south_texture>
    WE <path_to_west_texture>
    EA <path_to_east_texture>
    C 225,30,0
    F 0,0,0

    ```
- Those identifiers are followed with the 2D map data, that defines the space/maze.
- A basic (non-bonus) map must be composed of only 6 characters: 0 (empty walkable space), 1 (wall), and N, S , E or W for the start position and spawning
orientation of the player. Bonus map allows another character: D (door).
- A map must be closed/surrounded by walls

---

## Limitations

- Bonus part: for the sake of time only the first two dooes will have unique sprites behind them, after that they are repeated. Also only the first three doors are numbered. More sprites can be easily added to make it a proper calender.
- Generall limitations of the raycasting technology (it is a pseudo-3D space, sprites are 2D).
- Limitations of the miniLibX library (e.g. fixed window size, textures must be of xpm format).
- Beware of the “Power of Two” rule, when using your own wall textures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eluscha/cub3D.git cub3D
   cd cub3D
   ```

2. For simple version (without sprites, etc.):

   ```bash
   make
   ./cub3D <map_name>
   ```

3. For bonus features (advent calender):

   ```bash
   make bonus
   ./cub3D <bonusmap_name>
   ```

## Usage

### Basic functionality

- Launch the executable with an appropriate map (examples provided in the repo).
- Use <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, and <kbd>D</kbd> keys to move through the maze.
- Use <kbd>left</kbd> and <kbd>right</kbd> arrow keys to look left and right.
- Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> or cross to exit.

### Bonus functionality

- You can use the mouse to look left and right.
- To open doors come closer to them and press the <kbd>space</kbd>.

## Built With

- **C Language** - The core programming language used.
- **miniLibX graphics library** - a simple X-Window programming API in C, designed for educational purposes at 42.
